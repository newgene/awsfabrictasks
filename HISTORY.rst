Version 1.3.0b1
---------------
Whats new?

- Python 3 support.
  Thanks to Jo√£o Miguel Neves for submitting this
  patch (https://github.com/espenak/awsfabrictasks/pull/24).

Version 1.2.0
-------------

Whats new?

- Multitag Support
  As explained in https://github.com/espenak/awsfabrictasks/pull/11
  Thanks to Lucas Hrabovsky

Backwards incompatible changes:

- ``awsfabrictasks.ec2.api.Ec2InstanceWrapper.get_by_tagvalue()`` does not raise
  ``LookupError`` anymore. It returns an empty list instead.
- ``fabric.api.env`` and ``awsfabrictasks.ec2.api.Ec2InstanceWrapper`` is
  no longer imported in ``awsfabrictasks/__init__.py``. So if you have
  any code importing those from ``awsfabrictasks``, you need to update
  it to import from the correct place.
